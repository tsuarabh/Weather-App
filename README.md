# Weather-App
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process large-scale weather data efficiently. The pipeline extracts data from a weather API, transforms it (cleaning, filtering, aggregating), and loads it into a database using batch processing for optimized performance.
